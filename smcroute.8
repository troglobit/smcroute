.Sh NAME
.Nm smcroute
.Nd SMCRoute, a static multicast router
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm smcroute
.Op OPTIONS
.Op COMMANDS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command line tool to manipulate the multicast routes of a UNIX
kernel. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast routing. SMCRoute can
be used as an alternative to dynamic multicast routers like
.Nm mrouted
or
.Nm pimd
in situations where static multicast routes should be maintained and/or
no proper IGMP or MLD signaling exists.
.Pp
Generally multicast routes exists in the kernel only as long as smcroute
or another multicast routing daemon is running. Only one multicast
routing daemon can be active at a time, so it's impossible to run
smcroute and, e.g.,
.Nm mrouted
at the same time.
.Pp
Because
.Nm
modifies the kernel routing table it needs to run with full
.Ar superuser rights .
Which also means that the same applies to client operations, to be
able to communicate with the daemon.
.Ss WARNING
By using multiple output interfaces (traffic multiplication), using the
input interface also as output interface (direct loop) or constructing
some other forms of indirect loops you can easily flood your networks!
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Starts the smcroute daemon before any of the optional following commands
are executed. Please note, if started with the
.Fl n
flag no commands specified on the command line will be run.
.It Fl n
Run in foreground, do not detach from the calling terminal.  This also
means that any further commands from that command line are run.  Option
flags, however, are accepted, but not command flags.
.It Fl f Ar FILE
Specify an alternative configuration file, instead of the default
.Pa /etc/smcroute.conf .
.It Fl v
Display version and enable verbose logs.  This gives a more verbose
output in some error situations.  Do not expect too much, see syslog
instead.
.It Fl D
Enable additional debug messages.  Do not expect too much, see syslog
instead.
.It Fl h
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl k
Stop (kill) running daemon.
.El
.Pp
The 
.Fl d
option to smcroute starts the smcroute daemon. It can be started in the
foreground using the
.Fl n
option. The
.Fl k
option will terminate a running daemon.  The 
.Fl f Ar FILE
option can be used to tell the daemon to setup routes from a conf
file. By default it looks for /etc/smcroute.conf
.Sh COMMANDS
The following are commands that can only be passed to an already running daemon.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar IFNAME SOURCE GROUP IFNAME [IFNAME ...]
Add a kernel multicast route from {IFNAME, SOURCE & GROUP} to a list of,
at least one, outbound IFNAME.  The interfaces can be any network
interface as listed by 'ifconfig' or 'ip link list' (incl. tunnel
interfaces), but not the loopback interface.  Please note that the
.Ar SOURCE
address is the unicast IPv4 or IPv6 source address of the multicast
sender! The 
.Ar GROUP
can be either an IPv4 or IPv6 formatted multicast group address.
.It Fl r Ar IFNAME SOURCE GROUP
Remove a kernel multicast route.
.It Fl j Ar IFNAME GROUP
Join a multicast group on a given interface.
.It Fl l Ar IFNAME GROUP
Leave a multicast group on a given interface.
.El
.Pp
To be able to add/remove routes or join/leave multicast groups the
.Nm
daemon must run.
.Pp
Multicast routes can be added with the 
.Fl a 
command and removed with the 
.Fl r
command. 
.Pp
A multicast route is defined by an input interface
.Ar IFNAME ,
the sender's unicast IP address
.Ar SOURCE ,
the multicast group
.Ar GROUP
and a list of, at least one, output interface
.Ar IFNAME [IFNAME ...] .
.Pp
The sender's address and the multicast group must both be IPv4 addresses
or IPv6 addresses.  If IPv4 addresses are specified then SMCRoute will
operate on the IPv4 multicast routes. If IPv6 addresses are specified
then SMCRoute will operate on the IPv6 multicast routes.
.Pp
The output interfaces are not needed when removing routes using the
.Fl r
command. The first three parameters are sufficient to identify the
source of the multicast route. 
.Pp
The intended purpose of
.Nm
is to aid in situations where dynamic multicast routing does not work
properly.  However, dynamic multicast routing is in nearly all cases the
preferred solution.  The reason for this is their ability to translate
Layer-3 signalling to Layer-2 dito (IGMP or MLD).
.Pp
.Nm
is capable of simple group join and leave by sending commands to the
kernel.  It handles sending Layer-2 IGMP/MLD join and leave frames.
This can be used for testing but is also useful sometimes to open up
multicast from the sender if located on a LAN with switches equipped
with IGMP/MLD Snooping.  Such devices will prevent forwarding of
multicast unless an IGMP/MLD capable router or multicast client is
located on the same physical port as you run
.Nm
on.  However, this feature of
.Nm
is only intended as a temporary workaround, and only 20 groups can be
joined this way (kernel limit).  For bigger installations it is strongly
recommended that the user instead fix the root cause to why the
designated multicast router does to receive all the required multicast
groups on its input interface(s).
.Pp
To emulate a multicast client using
.Nm
you use the
.Fl j
and
.Fl l
commands to issue join and leave commands for a given multicast group
on a given interface
.Ar IFNAME .
The
.Ar GROUP
may be given in an IPv4 or IPv6 address format.
.Pp
The command is passed to the daemon that passes it to the kernel. The
kernel then tries to join the multicast group
.Ar GROUP
on interface 
.Ar IFNAME
by starting IGMP, or MLD for IPv6 group address, signaling on the given
interface.  This signaling may be received by routers/switches connected
on that network supporting IGMP/MLD multicast signaling and, in turn,
start forwarding the requested multicast stream eventually reach your
desired interface.
.Pp
With this command
.Nm
allows the integration of nodes that need static multicast routing into
dynamic multicast routing domains.
.Pp
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE
From version 1.98.0 smcroute supports reading and setting up multicast
routes from a config file. The default location is
.Ar /etc/smcroute.conf ,
but this can be overridden using the
.Fl f Ar FILE
command line option.

#
# smcroute.conf example
#

# The exec command allows for executing a script, either on start/reload
# and/or when matching a source-less (ANY) rule.  Leave out the 'on' arg
# to allow the script to be called both when all static rules have been
# installed *and* every time a dynamic rule is installed.
#
# When a source-less rule is matched the script can read the multicast
# group and source address from the environment variables $source and
# $group.  When the script is called at start/reload those environment
# variables are unset, which can be used by the script to detect for
# which case it is being called.
#
# Syntax:
#   exec /path/to/script [optional params] [on <reload | install>]
#
# Example:
#exec conntrack -F

# The configuration file supports joining multicast groups, to use
# Layer-2 signaling so that switches and routers open up multicast
# traffic to your interfaces.  Leave is not supported, remove the
# mgroup and SIGHUP your daemon, or send a specific leave command.
#
# NOTE: Use of mgroup should really not be needed!  It is only available
#       to aid a user in figuring out problems in multicast forwarding.
#       Only 20 mgroup lines can be configured, this is a HARD kernel
#       maximum.  If you need more, you probably need to find another
#       way of forwarding multicast to your router.
#
# Similarily supported is setting mroutes. Removing mroutes is not
# supported, remove/comment out the mroute or send a remove command.
#
# Syntax:
#   mgroup from IFNAME group MCGROUP
#   mroute from IFNAME [source ADDRESS] group MCGROUP to IFNAME [IFNAME ...]
#
# The following example instructs the kernel to join the multicast
# group 225.1.2.3 on interface eth0.  Followed by setting up an
# mroute of the same multicast stream, but from the explicit sender
# 192.168.1.42 on the eth0 network and forward to eth1 and eth2.
#
mgroup from eth0 group 225.1.2.3
mroute from eth0 group 225.1.2.3 source 192.168.1.42 to eth1 eth2

# Here we allow routing of multicast to group 225.3.2.1 from ANY
# source coming in from interface eth0 and forward to eth1 and eth2.
# NOTE: Routing from ANY source is currently only available for IPv4
#       multicast.
mgroup from eth0 group 225.3.2.1
mroute from eth0 group 225.3.2.1 to eth1 eth2
.Ed
.Pp
Fairly simple. As usual, to identify the origin of the inbound multicast
we need the
.Ar IFNAME ,
the sender's IP address and, of course, the multicast group address,
.Ar MCGROUP .
The last argument is a list of outbound interfaces.
.Pp
From 1.99.0 the sender's IP address is actually optional for IPv4
multicast routes. If omitted it defaults to 0.0.0.0 (INADDR_ANY) and
will cause
.Nm
to dynamically at runtime add new routes, matching the group and inbound
interface, to the kernel. This feauture is experimental.
.Pp
Following the standard UNIX tradition the file format support comments
at the beginning of the line using a hash sign.  It is untested to have
comments at the end of a line, but should work.
.Pp
When starting up, the daemon by default lists the success of parsing each
line and setting up a route.
